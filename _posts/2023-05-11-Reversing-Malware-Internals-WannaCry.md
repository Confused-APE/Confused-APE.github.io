## Reversing WannaCry Ransomware

**NOTE:** The function and variable names are modified to make analysis easier.

### Loader (mssecsvc.exe)

#### KillSwitch

The sample 'mssecsvc.exe' was loaded in IDA Pro and then it was jumped to its main function.

![killswitch](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/1.png)

The killswitch URL (http://www[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com) is copied to killswitch variable. And that killswitch variable is passed as second parameter to InternetOpenUrlA API, which will open up that URL.

- If its successful, it will close the handle and simply exit
- If its unsuccessful, it will call service_mode() function

This killswitch capability of WannaCry could be to evade sandbox environment, which normally simulates the URL that the malware is trying to connect. By trying to reach out to a gibberish non-existence domain, the WannaCry will know if it’s running in sandbox environment. If it connects to the kill switch URL, it will simply exit without doing anything.

<br>

#### Service Mode

When killswitch is not reached, it calls service_mode() function, which can be seen below.

![service_mode](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/2.png)

First there is call to GetModuleFileNameA, which retrieve the full path to this sample. Then it checks if return value of GetModuleFileNameA API call has number of parameters less then 2.

- Since no parameters are passed during its execution, the condition will be valid and it will execute the initialize() function.

Under the initialize function, there are call to 2 functions; service_creator() and dropper()

![initialize](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/3.png)

First the service_creator() function will execute, which can be seen below.

![service_creator](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/4.png)

![rdata](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/5.png)

First it appends ‘-m security’ to the filename and stores under Buffer by calling sprintf.

Then it retrieves handle of service control manager database by calling OpenSCManagerA API, and using that handle it creates a service by calling CreateServiceA API. The parameters passed to CreateServiceA API are:

- The second parameter (lpServiceName) is passed with ‘mssecsvc2.0’.
- The third parameter (lpDisplayName) is passed with ‘Microsoft Security Center (2.0) Service’.
- The eighth parameter (lpBinaryPathName) is passed with Buffer. The Buffer stores the filename (full path of binary) with ‘-m security’ parameter.

So it will create a service of its own binary with ‘-m security’ parameter added to it, along with service name ‘mssecsvc2.0’ and display name ‘Microsoft Security Center (2.0) Service’. Here, the WannaCry is masquerading legitimate service name as defense evasion technique.

If the service is created successfully, it starts the service by calling StartServiceA API.

After that, the execution flow will reach dropper() function.

![initialize](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/6.png)

The dropper() function is shown in couple of parts below.

![dropper](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/7.png)

First it retrieves handle to some module (DLL) by calling GetModuleHandleW API. If it successfully retrieve the handle, then using that handle it will dynamically loads functions like CreateProcessA, CreateFileA, WriteFile and CloseHandle from that module by calling GetProcAddress API.

After dynamically loading those function, it also checks if it successfully loaded those API dynamically as can be seen below.

![dynamically load API](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/8.png)

After checking that, it perform some operation with its resource, which is stored under its resource section. First there is call to FindResourceA API to locate the resource named 0x727 (R in ASCII). On checking this sample on Resource Hacker, there is a resource named ‘R’ which seem to contain some PE format file. This could be the next stager.

![Resource hacker](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/9.png)

Then there is call to LoadResource API which retrieve handle to obtain pointer of first byte of ‘R’ resource. 

Immediately after that, there is call to LockResource API, which retrieve pointer to ‘R’ resource in memory. The return value that contain that pointer is stored under lpBuffer, which could be used later when writing to file.

Finally there is call to SizeOfResource API which retrieve the size of ‘R’ resource in byte.

After that it creates ‘C:\Windows\tasksche.exe’ and ‘C:\Windows\qeriuwjhrf’ by calling sprintf and save it under Buffer and NewFileName respectively as can be seen below.

![move file](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/10.png)

![rdata](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/11.png)

Then, there is call to MoveFileExA API to move Buffer (C:\Windows\tasksche.exe) to NewFileName (C:\Windows\qeriuwjhrf). During first time execution, it will not move any file since ‘tasksche.exe’ currently does not exist.

Immediately after this, there is call to CreateFileA API which creates tasksche.exe under C:\Windows directory.  So, only later when it again execute as service with ‘-m security’ parameter passed, it will move the ‘tasksche.exe’ to ‘qeriuwjhrf’ under the Windows directory when calling MoveFileExA.

The ‘tasksche.exe’ file is only created just now by CreateFileA. The data under it is written by calling WriteFile API as shown below. Notice the second parameter passed to WriteFile is lpBuffer, which previously contained the pointer to ‘R’ resource in memory which was returned by LockResource function. The next stager is extracted from ‘R’ resource of resource section and then written to ‘tasksche.exe’.

![second stager drop and execute](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/12.png)

Also, there is call to CreateProcessA where second parameter (lpCommandLine) passed is Buffer that store path to tasksche.exe. By calling CreateProcessA, the next stager ‘tasksche.exe’ dropped under C:\Windows directory will be executed.

<br>

#### Worm Mode

Before analyzing second stager, lets get back to service_mode() function, where it checked if number of parameters is less than 2.  

![worm mode](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/13.png)

![rdata](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/14.png)

As seen above, after checking the parameter, it calls OpenServiceManagerA to retrieve handle and using its handle it call OpenServiceA, which open ‘mssecsvc2.0’ service to retrieve the handle of that service. The handle is passed to service_editor() function. 

The service_editor() function can be seen below, where using the handle of service, it call ChangeServiceConfig2A API to changes the configuration parameters of ‘mssecsvc2.0’ service. The second parameter passed to ChangeServiceConfig2A API is 2 (SERVICE_CONFIG_FAILURE_ACTIONS), so it indicate what action the service controller should take on failure of that service. The action is indicated by Info[4] where 1 (SC_ACTION_RESTART) is passed. So on failure of that service, it will restart that service to ensure the service do not fail and exit.

![service fail handling](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/15.png)

Back to service_mode, there is call to StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA at the end as shown below, where the lpServiceName passed is ‘mssecsvc2.0’ and the lpServiceProc passed is worm_mode( ) function. So when this service process start, the dispatcher thread will invoke the worm_mode() function. 

![service fail handling](/images/2023-05-11-Reversing-Malware-Internals-WannaCry/16.png)

The worm_mode() function can be seen below. Under the worm_mode() function, first a control handler function is registered to handle service control requests by calling RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerA. And if its successful, it call ExploitEternalBlue() function.
